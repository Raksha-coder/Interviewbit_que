# Calculation order for Data Type 

calculation happens depending on higher order data type

double
float
long long int
long int
int
character

from bottom to top 

**INT_MAX** ==  INT_MAX is a in-defined variable used to see the maximum range of int data type.

**Example**:
7/2 == 3                (int/int == int),
7/2.0 == 3.5            (int/float == float),
'c' + 1  == 100         (char + int == int)
//99(ASCII) + 1


   
# data overflow (overflow in calculation)
1.int range ==             -10^9 to 10^9
2.long int range ==        -10^12  to 10^12
3.long long int range ==   -10^18 to 10^18

# precision error with double and float

 double and float do not give acurate value or fixed value, they does not support setprecision() very well
